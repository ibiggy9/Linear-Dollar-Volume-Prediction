# cannibalization-predictor
This model compares the revenues of various products before and after a new product launch and uses a PCA Algorithm to assess how much other products in a company's portfolio suffered as a result of the new product's new presence on shelf. The algorithm sums the effect across the specified period of inquiry. For example, if you were curious about the anticipated 12 week cannibalization, the effect would be averaged for that period and give a probability that trend would conitinue for another 12 weeks. 

This calculation is typically carried out across many years so it is recommended you analyize at least 1 year out so you can get a 2 year prediction coefficient as an output.
